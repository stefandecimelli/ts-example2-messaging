# Bilateral Browser Communication
This app is a sandbox for testing bilateral messages being sent to the server from the browser. 
I made this to learn two things:
 1. Socket.io, and how to go about starting a socket project
 2. Using only TypeScript for a Express.js server, and starting it from the ground up, no frameworks
